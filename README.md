# COVID-19-Pred
ANNs are a more suitable choice for time series forecasting.

**Data Preparation:**
Collect time-series COVID-19 data (e.g., daily case counts, deaths, recoveries) and any relevant features (e.g., public health policies, weather data).
Preprocess the data, scale it, and split it into training and testing sets.

**Model Architecture:**
Design a feedforward neural network with one or more hidden layers.
The input layer should match the number of features, and the output layer should have one neuron for single-output forecasting (e.g., daily cases).

**Data Preprocessing:**
Normalize or scale the data using Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization, or any suitable method to ensure the features are within a similar range.

**Building the Model:**
Use the Keras library to create a sequential model.
Add dense layers with appropriate activation functions for each layer (e.g., 'relu' for hidden layers, 'linear' for output layer for regression tasks).

**Compiling the Model:**
Compile the model using an appropriate loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam optimizer).

**Training the Model:**
Train the model using the training data with the fit() function, specifying the number of epochs and batch size.
Monitor the training process to avoid overfitting and adjust the model architecture or hyperparameters accordingly.

**Evaluation:**
Evaluate the model on a separate test set to assess its performance using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error).

**Forecasting:**
Use the trained ANN to forecast COVID-19 data based on new input data.
